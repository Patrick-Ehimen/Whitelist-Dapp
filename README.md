# Whitelist Contract
This contract allows for the whitelisting of a limited number of addresses. It has a constructor that sets the maximum number of whitelisted addresses, and a function that allows a caller to add their own address to the whitelist, provided that the caller's address has not already been whitelisted and the maximum number of whitelisted addresses has not been reached. The contract also keeps track of how many addresses are currently whitelisted.
